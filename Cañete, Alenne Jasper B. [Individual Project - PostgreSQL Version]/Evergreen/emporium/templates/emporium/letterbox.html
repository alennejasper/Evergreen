Greetings, {{customer}}!

The Evergreen's Emporium Letterbox merely wished for you to obtain the subsequent information with respect to the items you infused upon the basket earlier, {{date | date:"M. d, Y"}}.

Items Added to the Basket:
{% spaceless %}
{% for order in orders %} 
{{order.item.item_name}} x {{order.purchase_amount}} 
{% endfor %}
{% endspaceless %}

Total:
â‚±{{total | floatformat:2}}

By that means, the emporium administrator already verified your purchase today.

A courier meant for the delivery of plants will transfer the items you purchased herein!

Thereupon, please anticipate and expect the plants you wished to obtain for another entire three days, {{delivery | date:"M. d, Y"}}.

Thanks a million, and have a splendid day ahead!

Cordially yours,
Evergreen

P.S. {{customer}}, kindly convey your sincere concerns or feedbacks, if there is any, on the electronic mail, evergreen.postcard@gmail.com.
